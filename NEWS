Version 0.22 (2011-12-23):
 - Handle SLURM's RESIZING state in sqlog(1).

Version 0.21 (2011-12-08):
 - slurm-joblogger.pl: Do not use the NODECNT variable. It is likely to
    be incorrect. Instead always compute nodecount from the nodelist.
 - sqlog-db-util: Add new --recalc-nodecnt option that recalculates
    nodecount from nodelist on backfill.
 - sqlog: Fix "Use of uninitialized value" in sqlog on RUNNING jobs.

Version 0.20 (2011-08-23):
 - sqlog-db-util: Don't make failure to connect to DB a fatal error for
    all cases. (Fixes bug in initial DB creation).
 - sqlog-db-util: Always connect to DB via 'localhost' if -L is used.

Version 0.19 (2011-07-11):
 - Fix Issue 2: Use NODECNT environment variable if set by SLURM.
 - sqlog-db-util: Fix bug in initial DB creation.
 - Slightly better debug and error log messages.

Version 0.18 (2009-11-09):
 - Fix bug in sqlog preventing queries with -n, --nodes.

Version 0.17 (2009-10-23):
 - Add the skewstats(1) utility to the sqlog package.
 - The sqlog --regex option now only applies to the following job query
   option, instead of globally to all filter options. This mirrors the
   functionality of the --exclude option.

Version 0.16 (2009-10-12):
 - Fix broken sqlog-db-util -L, --localhost option.
 - Fix job name (-J, --job-name) filtering for running jobs.
 - Fix use of --regex queries on running jobs and against v2 database.

Version 0.15 (2009-05-07):
 - Fix sqlog -j, --jobids on systems with v2 database.

Version 0.14 (2009-04-09):
 - Try harder to log to joblog text file when database isn't accessible.
 - Handle datetime of NONE in database.
 - Properly handle slurm-1.4 squeue datetime format.

Version 0.13 (2009-04-02):
 - Update database schema from v1 to v2.
 - Added --covert, --backup, --prune, --obfuscate options to
   sqlog-db-util, as well as, --cores-per-node, --notrack,
   and --delay-index.  Added "CONVERTING" and "BACKING UP"
   sections to README to discuss new options.
 - Added new indicies to schema: increased from just: username
   to: username, jobname, starttime, endtime, runtime, nodecount,
   corecount, nodename.  Speeds up common queries.
 - Add corecount column to track number of cores allocated to each
   job, which is useful for machines using the consumable resources
   SLURM plugin.
 - Added --ncores, --mincores, --maxcores options to sqlog to
   specify conditions on new corecount column.
 - Extend nodelist column to fix truncation when very fragmented
   nodelists exceeded the 1024 char limit initially set for the field.

Version 0.12 (2008-12-03):
 - Do not use Date::Manip routines to convert dates to "Unix time"
   (seconds since epoch) Date::Manip doesn't handle daylight savings 
   transitions properly and instead uses the current DST offset.
 - New --regex option allows sqlog to query with regexes for jobids,
   user names, states, paritions, and job names, instead of a simple
   exact match.

Version 0.11 (2008-06-24):
 - New slurm-joblog.conf parameter $SQLNETWORK sets the network
   on which read access to database is allowed. Default = 192.168.%.%.
 - sqlog-db-util now deletes slurm* users from mysql DB before 
   creating new user entries to avoid stale privileges.

Version 0.10 (2008-04-18):

 - Improve RUNTIME parsing in sqlog script.

   various job state abbreviations.

 - Add more packages to RPM Requires
 - Fix test for whether job logfile is configured in slurm-joblog.pl.

Version 0.7 (2007-08-13):
 - Applied Py Watson's fixes for non-standard installs:
  -- Allow perl library path and PATH to be specified at RPM build time.
  -- Use __perl RPM macro instead of hardcoding /usr/bin/perl.
  -- Other specfile improvements.
 - Fix sqlog-db-util.8 manpage permissions.

Version 0.6 (2007-08-10):
 - Fix for bug in --end-before and --end-after argument processing.
 - Add new format keys: runtime_s (runtime in seconds) and unixstart/
   unixend (start and end times in seconds since the epoch).

Version 0.5 (2007-08-10):
 - Allow perl path (default = /usr/bin/perl) and
   confdir (default = /etc/slurm) to be overridden at RPM 
   build time via _slurm_confidir and _perl_path.

Version 0.4 (2007-08-07):
 - Fix for broken processing of -s, --states.
 - Sort keys are now applied in "ORDER BY" statement of database query.
 - New format keys "longstart" and "longend" for including year in output.
